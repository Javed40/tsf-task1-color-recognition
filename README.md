# tsf-task1-color-recognition
This was my First task as a Computer Vision &amp; IoT intern at The Sparks Foundation, in this task I had to implement a color recognition system which could identify any color in a given image.I did this using OpenCV and Panda to import csv file containing colors.I redeem R,G,B values from pixels and compare them with data in csv.

A Demo video of this can be seen at :
